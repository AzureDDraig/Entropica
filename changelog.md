# Changelog — Entropica Multi-Loader Migration Update

---

## Build 000-1a

### Added
*   **Directional Magical Diodes (One-Way Energy Gates)**:
    *   Added a brand new circuit node type: the **Diode** (represented by a "D" icon and a classic electronic diode schematic symbol). Diodes act as one-way gates for magical essence, letting energy pass through in only one direction.
    *   When you place or cycle a chalk node to a Diode, it automatically aligns itself to face the same direction your player is looking.
    *   Magical energy and colors can only enter the Diode from its backside (input) and flow out of its frontside (output). Energy trying to flow backwards or sideways is blocked.
    *   To prevent energy from leaking to adjacent lines, the Diode will only connect to other chalk blocks located directly in front of or behind it, automatically ignoring any lines trying to connect from the sides.
*   **8-Way Directional Overrides & 45-Degree Diagonal Branching**:
    *   Added manual connection controls for advanced chalk. Sneak+right clicking with the advanced chalk on an existing chalk block detects the cursor angle to target one of 8 direction sectors (cardinal and diagonal).
    *   Toggles between `DEFAULT` (auto-connect), `FORCE_CONNECT` (overriding parallel gates), and `FORCE_DISCONNECT`. Toggles are dynamically synchronized with adjacent chalk blocks.
    *   Implemented full 8-way essence level and color propagation across diagonal/cardinal overrides during chalk ticks.
*   **Soft Curved Corners (Bezier Fillets)**:
    *   Modified the renderer to draw smooth, rounded fillets at 90-degree corners instead of sharp mitered angles.
    *   Uses quadratic Bezier curve math to interpolate rendering segments between center points, while maintaining parallel offsets for side paths.
*   **Magic Circle Recipe Type & Ritual Execution**:
    *   Introduced a custom recipe type (`magic_circle`) using a flexible record structure containing input items, required runes, tier requirements, and required essence amounts.
    *   Implemented full JSON serialization and network packet synchronization via `MapCodec` and `StreamCodec`.
    *   Added a world-interaction trigger: right-clicking a Scribed Chalk block checks if it forms the center of a valid magic circle, scans the node layout for floating inputs/runes/essences, matches a recipe, consumes ingredients, and spawns the output with particle and sound effects.
*   **Just Enough Items (JEI) Compatibility**:
    *   Registered a custom recipe category for Magic Circles showing reagent items, rune requirements, and outputs.
    *   Renders dynamic labels for the minimum required circle tier and color-shifting essence values corresponding to the required essence type.
*   **PCB-Style 45-Degree Mitered Corners (Angled Bend Graphics)**:
    *   Improved the visual rendering of advanced circuit tracks when they turn a corner.
    *   Instead of drawing overlapping square blocks at 90-degree corners, the system now calculates custom coordinates to render smooth, professional-looking 45-degree mitered diagonal bends.
    *   This diagonal bend geometry is rendered for the bright center power line as well as the two thin outer parallel copper paths, making your ritual setups look like actual high-tech printed circuit boards.
*   **Dynamic & Shifting Essence Colors**:
    *   Updated the rendering of both scribed chalk lines, concentric magic circles, and the fluids/gases flowing inside all Vapor Pneumatic Pipes, Hydraulic Pipelines, and Conduits to fully support shifting, multi-stage, and prismatic colors.
    *   Previously, once these components were filled or dyed, they retained a static snapshot of the essence's starting color. Now, if an essence type has shifting color cycles (like Storm, Eclipse, or Prismatic), all of these components will smoothly pulse and flow through their color cycles in perfect synchronization on the client.

### Changed
*   **Smart Corner and Staircase Connection Detection (Improved Parallel Check)**:
    *   Redesigned the connection rules for advanced chalk lines to solve a bug where turns and bends wouldn't connect.
    *   Previously, the game blocked adjacent blocks from connecting if they ran parallel, but this accidentally blocked single circuit lines making a 90-degree bend, a loop, or a staircase-like slope because it thought the adjacent parts were separate parallel wires.
    *   The connection check is now much smarter: it only blocks adjacent lines from connecting if they are running in the exact same direction (running side-by-side). If the lines are turning a corner, stepping down in a staircase, or forming a loop, the system recognizes that they belong to the same path and connects them perfectly.

### Fixed
*   **Magic Circle Color Refresh Animation (Dynamic Re-Dyeing)**:
    *   Fixed a visual bug where changing the element type (color) of your energy source on an active magic circle wouldn't play the dyeing animation, leaving the old color statically visible or updating without smooth transition.
    *   Now, when the chalk circuit registers a change in essence/color, it automatically resets its visual wave timer back to zero. This triggers a fresh wave of color that flows smoothly from the source node throughout the entire magic circle system and all surrounding connections.

## Build 000-0a

### Added
*   **Architectury Multi-Loader Infrastructure**: Split the project into `:common`, `:neoforge`, and `:fabric` modules, utilizing platform-agnostic initializers and registration handlers to target multiple loaders from a single codebase.
*   **10-Stage Materia Cycle API**:
    *   Created `MateriaStack` as a generic, stateful base class supporting deep copying, capacity growing/shrinking, and `EssenceType` element tracking.
    *   Developed concrete, stage-specific subclasses (`MateriaFumusStack`, `MateriaSublimataStack`, `MateriaLiquidaStack`, `MateriaVolatilisStack`, `MateriaCoagulataStack`, `MateriaIchorStack`, `MateriaTransmutataStack`, `MateriaPerfectaStack`, `MateriaLiminaliaStack`).
    *   Integrated robust NBT serialization methods (`save`/`load` compound tags) to store and load Materia stack amounts and types across block entity saves, item stacks, and networking packets.
*   **Vapor & Hydraulic Handlers**:
    *   Added the `IVaporHandler` interface defining pressure-ratio dynamics, safe operating capacities (1.0 Pressure), absolute structural failure capacities (3.0 Pressure), and automated filling/draining methods for gaseous Fumus/Sublimata stacks.
    *   Added the `ILiquidMateriaHandler` interface defining simple capacity limitations and fluid transport operations for liquid Materia stacks.
*   **Vapor Pneumatic Pipes & Valve Blocks**:
    *   Added `VaporPneumaticPipeBlock` and `VaporPneumaticPipeBlockEntity` supporting copper, iron, gold, arcanite, diamond, viscanite, resonite, and charged variants.
    *   Added specialized gas-routing blocks including the `VaporPneumaticValveBlock` (manual flow toggle), `VaporPneumaticOneWayValveBlock` (forced unidirectional flow/venting), and `VaporPneumaticDiverterBlock` (network routing control).
    *   Implemented a custom BFS-based gas networking algorithm inside pipe entities to perform gas transport, pressure averaging, overpressure venting, and explosion handlers.
*   **8 Orbis Cell & Calix Variants**:
    *   Registered and implemented 8 new block/block-entity storage pairs to correspond to each stage of the Materia Cycle:
        *   `SublimatedOrbisCellBlock` / `SublimatedOrbisCellBlockEntity` (Stores T3 - Sublimata)
        *   `PneumaticCalixBlock` / `PneumaticCalixBlockEntity` (Stores T4 - Liquida)
        *   `VoltaicCalixBlock` / `VoltaicCalixBlockEntity` (Stores T5 - Volatilis)
        *   `MatrixCalixBlock` / `MatrixCalixBlockEntity` (Stores T6 - Coagulata)
        *   `ThecaCellBlock` / `ThecaCellBlockEntity` (Stores T7 - Ichor)
        *   `VasCellBlock` / `VasCellBlockEntity` (Stores T8 - Transmutata)
        *   `MonadCoreBlock` / `MonadCoreBlockEntity` (Stores T9 - Perfecta)
        *   `AthanorCoreBlock` / `AthanorCoreBlockEntity` (Stores T10 - Liminalis)
*   **Universal Decompression Coupler (T2-T10 one-way conversion)**:
    *   Added `DecompressionCouplerBlock` and `DecompressionCouplerBlockEntity` to perform straight-line, axis-aligned one-way Materia conversions (draining from higher tier, converting, and filling lower tier neighbor).
    *   Added coupler block models (`vapor_decompression_coupling_core.json`, `vapor_decompression_coupling_arm.json`), item model, and a `multipart` blockstate that renders the core and opposite-facing arms along its axis.
    *   Generated a custom 16x16 gradient texture (`decompression_coupling.png`) transitioning from silver to sky-blueish grey with a subtle brushed metal finish.
*   **1.21.10 Flattened Asset Support**:
    *   Converted resource directories to support Minecraft 1.21.10 asset specifications.
    *   Generated model definitions under `assets/entropica/items/` containing the new `"model": {"type": "minecraft:model", "model": "..."}` JSON layout structure.
    *   Generated matching 3D and 2D model parents under `assets/entropica/models/item/` and custom multi-part blockstates/models for all blocks.
*   **Dynamic Item Tinting**:
    *   Registered custom item tint source codecs (`entropica:essence_tint` and `entropica:ampoule_tint`) through the `RegisterColorHandlersEvent.ItemTintSources` event.
    *   Added multi-layered model JSON layouts for empty/filled Ampoules and Essence Orbs, mapping layer indexes to dynamic color sources that read element type component data.
*   **Enhanced Pipe & Fluid Shaders**:
    *   **Bottom-to-Top Liquid Levels**: Implemented bottom-to-top Y-axis clipping on T4-T7 conduits based on actual fill ratio, allowing fluid overlays to rise dynamically.
    *   **Volatilis Sparks (T5)**: Added a dynamic 3D electric arc generator that renders glowing, jagged electric paths between the fluid surface and the pipe core walls.
    *   **Ichor Shimmering (T7)**: Implemented a mellow, slow-breathing Sanguine heartbeat shimmer animation.
    *   **Perfecta Sheen (T9)**: Added a smooth, rapid periodic sheen sweep with an 80% cycle cooldown to keep the base color clean.
    *   **Liminalis Gold-Chrome (T10)**: Designed a camera-aligned specular chrome reflection shader with dark edge shading.

### Changed
*   **Generalization of Vapor Transport (Fumus / Sublimata)**:
    *   Generalized `IVaporHandler` and `VaporPneumaticPipeBlockEntity` to handle `MateriaStack` instead of `MateriaFumusStack`, enabling vapor pipes to carry both Fumus (T2) and Sublimata (T3) stacks.
*   **Creative Generator Dynamic Tier Resolution**:
    *   Updated `CreativeMateriaGeneratorBlockEntity` to dynamically query the neighbor's cycle tier (T2-T10) using the coupler's tier checker, pushing the correct `MateriaStack` class into any connected pipe/conduit.
*   **Standardized Terminology (Vis $\rightarrow$ Materia)**:
    *   **Essence Items**: Updated `getName()` inside `EssenceItem.java` to dynamically prefix and format tier-0 items as `"Materia Fragment: "` instead of `"Vis Fragment: "` to match the Materia Cycle terminology.
    *   **Creative Tab Registrations**: Renamed `VIS_ITEMS_TAB` to `MATERIA_ITEMS_TAB` inside `ModCreativeTabs.java` and modified the registry key from `"vis_items_tab"` to `"materia_items_tab"`.
    *   **Translation Mapping Overhaul**: Reconfigured translations in `en_us.json` to replace legacy "Vis" terms with "Materia" or "Materia Fumus":
        *   Changed creative tab title `"itemGroup.entropica.vis_items"` from `"Entropica: Vis Items"` to `"Entropica: Materia Items"`.
        *   Updated items: `"Vis Value Detector"` $\rightarrow$ `"Materia Value Detector"`, `"Vis Capacitor Plate"` $\rightarrow$ `"Materia Capacitor Plate"`.
        *   Updated blocks: `"Vis Exhaust"` $\rightarrow$ `"Materia Exhaust"`.
        *   Updated gas settings: `"Vis Fume Settings"` $\rightarrow$ `"Vapor Pneumatic Network Settings"` and `"Vis Fume Pressure Vessel"` $\rightarrow$ `"Materia Fumus Pressure Vessel Settings"`.
        *   Updated item descriptions and tooltips: `"ambient static Vis"` $\rightarrow$ `"ambient static Materia"`, `"Vis Fumes"` $\rightarrow$ `"Materia Fumus"`, and `"Vis Vitae *"` $\rightarrow$ `"Materia Vitae *"` (e.g. `"Materia Vitae Pipe"`, `"Materia Vitae Anchor"`).
*   **Pipe Capacity & Progression Rebalance**:
    *   **Gold Pipes**: Re-slotted as an early-to-mid tier upgrade option, lowering default capacity from `500` to **`80`** and default transfer rate from `50` to **`20`** in `EntropicaNeoForgeConfig.java` and `EntropicaConfigImpl.java`.
    *   **Diamond Pipes**: Shifted up the progression ladder to sit between Charged Arcanite and Resonite, increasing default capacity from `80` to **`250`** and default transfer rate from `20` to **`40`**.
    *   **Viscanite Pipes**: Reduced safe capacity from `500` to **`300`** to match the Resonite capacity tier.
    *   **Charged Viscanite Pipes**: Reduced safe capacity from `1,000` to **`500`** to match the balanced top-tier limit.
    *   **Charged Resonite Pipes**: Reduced safe capacity from `50,000` to **`500`** (and transfer rate to **`5,000`**) to align on the same late-game capacity tier as Charged Viscanite while retaining a high flow rate.

### Fixed
*   **Gradle Production Transform Failures**:
    *   Resolved an issue where Architectury Loom's `transformProduction` tasks threw silent `ClassNotFoundException` errors and outputted empty production jars due to a lack of classpath references inside its task ClassLoader.
    *   Implemented a Gradle hook in [common/build.gradle](file:///c:/Users/Ddraig__/Downloads/MODS_CREATION/Entropica/common/build.gradle) that dynamically extracts `compileClasspath` URL paths, registers them into the task ClassLoader at runtime in `doFirst`, and re-runs the class transformation in `doLast` to cleanly compile production jars for Fabric and NeoForge.
*   **Fabric Translucency Rendering Crash**:
    *   Resolved a compilation and launch crash inside [EntropicaClientFabric.java](file:///c:/Users/Ddraig__/Downloads/MODS_CREATION/Entropica/fabric/src/main/java/ddraig/net/entropica/fabric/EntropicaClientFabric.java) where obsolete `RenderType.translucent()` references caused classloader failures on startup.
    *   Mapped block rendering translucency sheets to Minecraft 1.21.10 standard render map sheets `Sheets.translucentItemSheet()`.
*   **Missing Legacy Assets**:
    *   Resolved an asset loading issue where the new multi-loader sub-modules failed to pull assets from the legacy mod directories.
    *   Migrated **358 missing asset files** (comprising textures, block models, blockstates, item animations, and sound loops) from the root legacy folder path to `common/src/main/resources/assets/` to ensure all elements compile.
*   **Vapor Pipe Placement Crash**:
    *   Fixed a client-side classloading desynchronization crash that occurred when placing a Vapor Pneumatic pipe in a world.
    *   Resolved a JVM offset cache conflict by ensuring nested inner classes (specifically `PipeTier` inside `VaporPneumaticPipeBlockEntity`) load correctly on the main thread during world ticking events.
*   **Optional Entity Tag Registry Warnings**:
    *   Converted modded drops entity tags (like `alexsmobs`, `twilightforest`, etc.) to use the optional registry format (`"required": false`), preventing console warnings and load validation failures when optional mods are not present.
*   **Missing Item Model Warnings**:
    *   Created item model JSON files under `assets/entropica/items/` for all 10 custom alloy vapor pneumatic pipes and the `materia_pump` to comply with Minecraft 1.21.2+ asset directory requirements, resolving startup missing-model errors.
*   **Creative Generator Rendering Crashes**:
    *   Refactored `CreativeParticleGeneratorRenderer`, `CreativeMateriaGeneratorRenderer`, and `CreativeVisFumeGeneratorRenderer` to extract player hover checks during the thread-safe client game-tick `extractRenderState` phase, avoiding illegal concurrent queries to game-thread state on the render thread during `submit`.
    *   Added `bufferSource.endBatch()` inside submit methods to cleanly finalize text rendering buffers.
*   **Registry Bounds Safety**:
    *   Added bounds checks to `CreativeParticleGeneratorBlockEntity.loadAdditional()` to prevent startup indexing crashes when `validParticles` list is empty.
